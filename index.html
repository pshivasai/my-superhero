                In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal
                war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is vengeance. He is the
                night. He is Batman. <br />
                One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman
                has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all
                criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken
                from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he
                has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be
                a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology
                that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of
                his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the
                Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated. A playboy billionaire by
                day,<br />
                Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life
                without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the
                perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves
                beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he
                sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed
                cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of
                Gotham City.
